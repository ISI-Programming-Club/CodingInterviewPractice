Given an array arr[] of size N where every element is in the range from 0 to n-1. Rearrange the given array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]].

Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {1,0}
Output: 0 1
Explanation: 
arr[arr[0]] = arr[1] = 0.
arr[arr[1]] = arr[0] = 1.

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4,0,2,1,3}
Output: 3 4 2 0 1

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^7
0 <= Arr[i] < N
