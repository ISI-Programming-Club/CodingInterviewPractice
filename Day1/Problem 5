Given K sorted arrays arranged in the form of a matrix of size K*K. The task is to merge them into one sorted array.

Input:
K = 3
arr[][] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Explanation:Above test case has 3 sorted
arrays of size 3, 3, 3
arr[][] = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6], 
[7, 8, 9]]
The merged list will be 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].


Input:
K = 4
arr[][]={{1,2,3,4}{2,2,3,4},
         {5,5,6,6},{7,8,9,9}}
Output:
1 2 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 8 9 9

Constraints:
1 <= K <= 100
